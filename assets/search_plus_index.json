    "body": "The obituary style picture is my profile picture in LinkedIn, and that could explain my lack of success in the job market overall. Currently, I am a Research Associate at Harvard Business School. I studied in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for my undergraduate degree, and aspiring to get a PhD sometime in the future. As to which PhD program, I do not know, and my interest lies sporadically and widely across Economics, Philosophy, Social Sciences, Linguistics in general, but also Mathematics and Computer Science. Does that make me a polymath? No. Definitely not. An aspiring polymath maybe, but that is no longer a thing in the world that I currently live in. That is a whole separate rabbit hole that I don’t want to go into this page. But that is me in a nutshell, not the most interesting person in the world, and I am learning how to be okay with that."

Eviction in Nebraska TODO Bandwagon Effect: Evidence from USPTO Data This project was initially started as a fun project back in UNL, exploring the great and interesting world of graph database and graph analysis. Unfortunately, a lot of that is now relegated to the side (the graph-side of things). The good thing is, I am currently working on a paper based on this analysis on the Bandwagon Effect in R&amp;D for firms. Really excited about it and hopefully something will come out of it! GitHub Repo Neo4j Conference Patient Zero Imagine a vaccine that could distribute itself. No appointments, no shipping, no expiration dates. This vaccine would be be created by making a more infectious but less deadly variant of the disease. Then a Patient Zero would be infected and sent into the population to spread the vaccine. Unethical? Almost certainly. Interesting to study? Absolutely! GitHub Repo Paper Airbnb in New York This is an exploration of a dataset of Airbnb listings in New York City from 2008 to 2021. Here we explored different Data Mining algorithms to identify patterns within the dataset with a strong geospatial emphasis. GitHub Repo"

The alternative in the actual Computer Science department was a disaster, and nobody ended up learning anything from that experience. Luck defined that year, with a complete unexpected alignment of what I was doing in my own research, and the privilege to be in a fantastic team, both amongst ourselves (Kyle &amp; Eric, and Sophia &amp; Emily) and our Sponsor (Patrick). Working on technology that I had a lot of passion in (Neo4j’s Graph Database), while learning and picking up ones that grind my gears (C#), it was a blast, and a tipping point for all the opportunities that came after.

    "body": "White Noise Ongoing Designing an Internet Ongoing Generations Late September 2024 Kindred Early October 2024 In the Land of Invented Languages 24 September 2024 I have never thought that languages can be so interesting, quirky, weird and a defining interest of a person. That being said, I am of course an aspiring GigaChad polyglot that knows my way perfectly about the nuances of natural languages, but definitely not the world of ConLang. The author neatly demonstrates how many of these languages were constructed out of idealistic goals, for world peace or perfect, rational thought, or to even prove to Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Yet ironically the most successful of all, is Klingon, a constructed language meant to be difficult, horrible sounding, and honestly pointless from a ‘rational’ perspective, yet carries enough aesthetic meaning (if you can call that) to learners of this language that it has survived thus far. I still could not believe that some people actually would take a vow of only speaking Klingon, which is a prime example of a deliciously useless idea! Evicted Mid September 2024 Reading this book while reflecting on my situation in Boston was interesting. As of writing, I am working part time due to a conflict that arose with one of my professor, and I was effectively living with a monthly paycheck of approximately $1750, with $1400 going into rent alone. It was not miserable, but it was not comfortable. In some ways, I thought that this was an unsustainable way to live, to only find out that many of the most vulnerable in the richest country on Earth are forced to work with much less, living in conditions way worse, and left with crumbs compared to mine, just to make sure there is a roof over their head. I have been interested in Evicted and the eviction process thanks in large part to Danny, who has used this in countless examples when I was in his Econometrics class, as well as when I am TAing the very same class as well. Helping him on research in the eviction process in NE opened up such an unknown legal procedure to people like me, as we are often shielded from this. Desmond showed how ‘pink slips’ are more than just common for the poor people, but a fact that they have to deal with constantly, unchallenged. Putting real stories and faces in this common tragedy put one into perspective of the pain, struggle, and anxiety that one can be thrust upon for simply not having enough rent. Desmond painted a painfully honest portrait of what is like to be constantly at the verge of losing your home, with the constant threat of eviction and the systemic problems of housing, welfare, that traps many in this constant cycle, effectively deprives them of a house, even if they have a roof on top of their head. The New Breed 20th of June 2024 Analogies help us communicate so much with so little, and despite the hate (though often warranted) of legal practitioners (and scholars) receive for their know-how, they do tend to do a good job using analogies to tell stories, and the winning stories in the courtrooms then proceed to shape our society. Kate Darling, just as other great legal scholars, took a somewhat counterintuitive break of human comparisons of robots, but instead comparing robots to creatures we have already come to know, to love, and to live with, animals, as pets, as companions, as workers, and sadly, as food and entertainment. She revealed something so apparent to us, yet subtly hidden due to our fascinations to human-like robots, or intelligence defined by capabilities that we can do, that we have blinded this clear analogy as robots being similar (but NOT the same) to animals. A very interesting read, and it definitely captivated my interest, especially given the type of work that Julian does. The Discrete Charm of the Machine 1st of June 2024 It took me by a surprise that computers were historically not bits and bytes I came to learn and love, but had analog counterparts that I only saw on TV, familiar with the problems and the occassional violence we bestow on them when they fail to work, to only realize that we had traversed a long way to this digital age. And digital, in this sense, was not referring to ‘electronics’ as a general category, but the very distinctly discrete way computers work today. Almost like an old grandpa of mine, narrating the many trials and tribulations in the noise-prone, clunky machines in the past, yet given his knowledge in Computer Science, Steiglitz managed to open my mind up to many things I wouldn’t have ever known, having only lived in a digitized world. I don’t know if this was meant for a non-technical audience, but understanding some background in CS allowed me to appreciate this book even more. An interesting thing was, reading this book released a mental block I had about the nature of P = NP, specifically with how he discussed the motivation of Cook-Levine’s Theorem on 3SAT’s hardness. It was beautiful, and of course charming too it its own machinistic ways. A Most Elegant Equation Finished in Mid May 2024 I took a pretty long break in continuing this blog. Not that I haven’t read anything significant, though I really did take a break in blogging on my side. Many things have happened, but this is nonetheless the best time to talk about Elegant Equation, as Nathan, my sweet sweet darling, is one elegant equation of his own right. Pausing to reflect, pushing to relate, those are just some fascinating things David Stipp encouraged me to do through this book, as we reflected on Euler’s Equation from its simplicity, to its elegance, but most importantly to its connectivity to many unrelated things. The first time I recall encountering this equation, it was introduced to me in Group Theory as a root of unity, and later in Module Theory as Eloisa so swiftly and graciously proved the relationship. I was then, so unsuspecting of its beauty, that I let it slipped, mainly due to the crunch of time and pressure, of a daunting homework set in front of me. Now that I have some time to ponder, I have been blessed to reflect, and of course, with the wonders of the Boston Public Library, given a chance to be amazed by life’s simple things. Algorithms to Live By Read for way too long but finished in, 25th of January 2024 One of the most interesting books that I have read, though I believe that my understanding in the field of computer science greatly complemented such understanding. Though relating all of these methods, from the idea of algorithms, the cold, hard science (or methods) to achieve some desired outcome to have parallels in life’s greatest challenge was an interesting take, as long as you are willing to accept the assumptions. Counterintuitively, these ideas made me really think what it means to learn and study computer science, as a field, as a discipline, where the ideas and insights do not only solve computational problems in the “computational sense” but also, in very humanly domains. It is a 10/10 read for sure. Same As Ever Listened, December 2023 If you’d told me that I’d be reading a ‘futurist’ book called Same As Ever, I’d probably call you out for your bullshit. Yet it was, oddly entertaining, not too sure about the validity, but quipped with an unforgetable line “The grass is always greener on the side that is fertilized with bullshit.” With my attention honing into my current disdain of “predictions”, or what not, this book does resonate, and does highlight something most statisticians would agree. That is, we can only reliably interpolate our results to the future and have more confidence in it for things that don’t change, not those that do. Perhaps those are the things worth investigating, a food for thought. Dirtbag, Massachusetts December 2023 Fitzgerald had the life that I will never have, and I am not saying it enviously in any way. My life, up to this point, has been immeasurably better by any accounts, and maybe this is some kind of poverty porn for me. The very raw and honest stories by Fitzgerald gave me a different perspective of how life could have been, but in many ways, how I have chosen to see my life thus far. I was never as carefree as he was in his early twenties, and that is a good thing, right? Not sure if I can unlearn that. But troubles and traumas give you learnable lessons too, and I believe (in fact quite explicitly stated by Fitzgerald) that he wanted to impart some of the bitter lessons he learned. And that is his life, for better or worse. It reminded me of a Chinese saying “出淤泥而不染” that I wish is true, but is unfortunately not in most cases. And some traumas linger, just as his tattoos on him. Not sure if I can unlearn that. On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous Read first in the midst of the pandemic, then again in November 2023 “I am thinking of beauty again, how some things are hunted because we have deemed them beautiful. If, relative to the history of our planet, an individual life is so short, a blink, as they say, then to be gorgeous, even from the day you’re born to the day you die, is to be gorgeous only briefly.” ― Ocean Vuong I picked this book up in all sincerity because I was longing for some gay fiction, with hope that a little smut will sneak in, and boy did I get some of that. What I’ve not expected from this experience, was a heart-wrenching story that made me think, and cry, and it enveloped me with emotions I’ve never felt with this masterpiece. My eyes scanned through the words, to only go a few sentences back, adjusting myself to sit upright, and carefully read the lines, looking around, zoning out, reminding myself this is not real life. Loving someone can be so painful, when we are on divergent paths. Losing them forever, is a stab in the heart. I miss you more than I remember you. ― Ocean Vuong America is Not the Heart Read in November 2023 “You already know that the first thing that makes you foreign to a place is to be born poor in it; you don’t need to emigrate to America to feel what you already felt when you were ten, looking up at the rickety concrete roof above your head and knowing that one more bad typhoon would bring it down to crush your bones and the bones of all your siblings sleeping next to you; or selling fruit by the side of the road to people who made sure to never really look at you, made sure not to touch your hands when they put the money in it. You’ve been foreign all your life. When you finally leave, all you’re hoping for is a more bearable kind of foreignness.” ― Elaine Castillo My home to me, today at least, is as foreign as it can get. Here, without my family nor loved ones, but despite the distance, feels more like ‘home’. A story about leaving behind the world you knew, one that spat on your face, and turning around to another that you don’t belong, but finding warmth and familiarty in it. I’d like to tell that story. And of course, mine wasn’t fraught with violence, abandonment, and unrelentless work, but the book resonated with me in inexplicable ways. It reminded me of mum. It reminded me of the journey, of immigration, the idealization of home, to find disappointing apparitions of the past that haunt you till this day. Regardless, Castillo chose to close the story with pancit, a lot of it in fact, filling the mouths (and hearts) of the De Vera family in spite of the simmering tensions that characterize family life."
