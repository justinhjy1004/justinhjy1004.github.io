    "body": "The obituary style picture is my profile picture in LinkedIn, and that could explain my lack of success in the job market overall. Currently, I am a Research Associate at Harvard Business School. I studied in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for my undergraduate degree, and aspiring to get a PhD sometime in the future. As to which PhD program, I do not know, and my interest lies sporadically and widely across Economics, Philosophy, Social Sciences, Linguistics in general, but also Mathematics and Computer Science. Does that make me a polymath? No. Definitely not. An aspiring polymath maybe, but that is no longer a thing in the world that I currently live in. That is a whole separate rabbit hole that I don’t want to go into this page. But that is me in a nutshell, not the most interesting person in the world, and I am learning how to be okay with that."

Eviction in Nebraska TODO Bandwagon Effect: Evidence from USPTO Data This project was initially started as a fun project back in UNL, exploring the great and interesting world of graph database and graph analysis. Unfortunately, a lot of that is now relegated to the side (the graph-side of things). The good thing is, I am currently working on a paper based on this analysis on the Bandwagon Effect in R&amp;D for firms. Really excited about it and hopefully something will come out of it! GitHub Repo Neo4j Conference Patient Zero Imagine a vaccine that could distribute itself. No appointments, no shipping, no expiration dates. This vaccine would be be created by making a more infectious but less deadly variant of the disease. Then a Patient Zero would be infected and sent into the population to spread the vaccine. Unethical? Almost certainly. Interesting to study? Absolutely! GitHub Repo Paper Airbnb in New York This is an exploration of a dataset of Airbnb listings in New York City from 2008 to 2021. Here we explored different Data Mining algorithms to identify patterns within the dataset with a strong geospatial emphasis. GitHub Repo"

The alternative in the actual Computer Science department was a disaster, and nobody ended up learning anything from that experience. Luck defined that year, with a complete unexpected alignment of what I was doing in my own research, and the privilege to be in a fantastic team, both amongst ourselves (Kyle &amp; Eric, and Sophia &amp; Emily) and our Sponsor (Patrick). Working on technology that I had a lot of passion in (Neo4j’s Graph Database), while learning and picking up ones that grind my gears (C#), it was a blast, and a tipping point for all the opportunities that came after.

    "body": "Why We Cannot Have Good Things 15th January 2024 Frowns, furrowed brows. Not of distress, nor his awkward stretches in the restaurant were part of my routine. The unfamiliarity of course, leads to staring, and the occassional smiles as I gleaned at his face. Wondering if there was any cue for me to seize upon, as my desire to please and entertain egged me on. I’d like to believe that it is all relative; jokes in South Park about the Last of the Meheecans could be literature in a slightly different world. But this is not the world that I live in. When he was about to speak, I abruptly cut him off. Unintentionally. But the stress of silence, as I stuttered nonsense, were strips of solitude I could not bare. Fidgeting, and rubbing his fingers, he would look at me with his beautiful face, with his gentle voice he would say, “yeah.” That is why I cannot have good things. Nothing Has (Really) Changed 14th January 2024 The uncomfortable truth, (re)surfacing. Then, why this? Why now? It is so clearly all this time, yet I have been just pretending. What has been the trigger? A rude awakening. About myself, about this world. Downgrading 12th January 2024 It’s really not that different, to be frank. Ending a relationship with someone that you ex-ante thought to be a great fit for you, as part of your life. You want him to be in your life; thinking that the world would just be that different without his presence. But this is no relationship, it was not that serious, and it is probably not that serious on his side too. You have seen him turn against you. So, what more is there to say about this series of unfortunate events? A part of you feels that this came from your friends. How coincidental is it for you to need a breakup, a callout, and a yelling match to reach this conclusion? But, it is not a coincidence. You need that to be aware of things. I wonder how much lie lurking beneath you when you want to see the best in everyone. Gullibility at your best. A part of you feels that this comes from the need to disassociate. Being related to someone that has a history does not always shine the best light on you. It never does in fact. But how convenient, isn’t it? To kick someone when they are already down. Maybe they deserve it. And maybe, you are not a saint. A part of you hopes that this is a reflection of your values. You don’t tolerate folks that are classist, racist, and sexist. You have successfully painted him as such. To uphold your values, you must denounce such actions, as complacency breeds conformity, and you start seeing him in yourself. That is what you are up against, and you, the righteous shall rise to grace. Consider the alternative though, why all this now? Why all this, when you can just choose to be indifferent. His life is his, and yours, yours. Clicking a downgrade button is not too bad. Relationships falter. Now once a blossoming friendship, it is time to relegate it into an acquaintance. And that, is okay. Not Today 8th of January 2024 Mondays are said to be the worst, and they are. As I am drinking my wine, drowning my woes; I could not help to feel a little part of me wants me to feel worse than I actually am, manufacturing dissent, if you will, in this life that I have. That could be entirely true. But what gripe do I have in evaluating decent work done by brilliant participants? Could one tell? Could one tell that I am being immature, complaining in the sidelines while allowing this to live in my head rent free? Why do I actually care, or why do I not? I should make a decision. And the truth is, there is a lot of wisdom in my professors who could navigate all this bullshit and stay afloat regardless, and maybe I am here to learn that. Tolerance to this, whole, farce… At least that is how it feels at times. Learning to be grateful is indeed hard, especially when you are raised so privileged. If you could not name the problem, then, it isn’t a problem. It is probably in your head. A Personal Reminder 31st of December 2023 It would be disingenuous to say that I had to leave behind a lot in 2023. I did, but they were choices. Intentional, brimmed with the excitement of change. I had given up many things, and in return, I had received a lot. That, I should always remind myself. As the arbitrary number approaches that defines our world, I have the all too familiar task to do in my small apartment in Boston, MA. A state whose name I could not spell without doing a Google Search. aAstate that I grew to adore and love, but harbour a sense of distaste from the lingering memories of comfort from Lincoln. ‘Estas por encima del mundo’ is perhaps not the right way to phrase things, neither does it make me feel better about myself. But I am somewhere that matters, somewhere that, that if I just could be honest to myself, is miles better than what most people have. That, I do have to remind myself that."

    "body": "Same As Ever Listened, December 2023 If you’d told me that I’d be reading a ‘futurist’ book called Same As Ever, I’d probably call you out for your bullshit. Yet it was, oddly entertaining, not too sure about the validity, but quipped with an unforgetable line “The grass is always greener on the side that is fertilized with bullshit.” With my attention honing into my current disdain of “predictions”, or what not, this book does resonate, and does highlight something most statisticians would agree. That is, we can only reliably interpolate our results to the future and have more confidence in it for things that don’t change, not those that do. Perhaps those are the things worth investigating, a food for thought. Dirtbag, Massachusetts December 2023 Fitzgerald had the life that I will never have, and I am not saying it enviously in any way. My life, up to this point, has been immeasurably better by any accounts, and maybe this is some kind of poverty porn for me. The very raw and honest stories by Fitzgerald gave me a different perspective of how life could have been, but in many ways, how I have chosen to see my life thus far. I was never as carefree as he was in his early twenties, and that is a good thing, right? Not sure if I can unlearn that. But troubles and traumas give you learnable lessons too, and I believe (in fact quite explicitly stated by Fitzgerald) that he wanted to impart some of the bitter lessons he learned. And that is his life, for better or worse. It reminded me of a Chinese saying “出淤泥而不染” that I wish is true, but is unfortunately not in most cases. And some traumas linger, just as his tattoos on him. Not sure if I can unlearn that. On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous Read first in the midst of the pandemic, then again in November 2023 “I am thinking of beauty again, how some things are hunted because we have deemed them beautiful. If, relative to the history of our planet, an individual life is so short, a blink, as they say, then to be gorgeous, even from the day you’re born to the day you die, is to be gorgeous only briefly.” ― Ocean Vuong I picked this book up in all sincerity because I was longing for some gay fiction, with hope that a little smut will sneak in, and boy did I get some of that. What I’ve not expected from this experience, was a heart-wrenching story that made me think, and cry, and it enveloped me with emotions I’ve never felt with this masterpiece. My eyes scanned through the words, to only go a few sentences back, adjusting myself to sit upright, and carefully read the lines, looking around, zoning out, reminding myself this is not real life. Loving someone can be so painful, when we are on divergent paths. Losing them forever, is a stab in the heart. I miss you more than I remember you. ― Ocean Vuong America is Not the Heart Read in November 2023 “You already know that the first thing that makes you foreign to a place is to be born poor in it; you don’t need to emigrate to America to feel what you already felt when you were ten, looking up at the rickety concrete roof above your head and knowing that one more bad typhoon would bring it down to crush your bones and the bones of all your siblings sleeping next to you; or selling fruit by the side of the road to people who made sure to never really look at you, made sure not to touch your hands when they put the money in it. You’ve been foreign all your life. When you finally leave, all you’re hoping for is a more bearable kind of foreignness.” ― Elaine Castillo My home to me, today at least, is as foreign as it can get. Here, without my family nor loved ones, but despite the distance, feels more like ‘home’. A story about leaving behind the world you knew, one that spat on your face, and turning around to another that you don’t belong, but finding warmth and familiarty in it. I’d like to tell that story. And of course, mine wasn’t fraught with violence, abandonment, and unrelentless work, but the book resonated with me in inexplicable ways. It reminded me of mum. It reminded me of the journey, of immigration, the idealization of home, to find disappointing apparitions of the past that haunt you till this day. Regardless, Castillo chose to close the story with pancit, a lot of it in fact, filling the mouths (and hearts) of the De Vera family in spite of the simmering tensions that characterize family life."
