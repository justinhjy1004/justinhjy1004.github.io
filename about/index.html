          <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p><em>Last Updated: 30th September 2022</em></p>

<p>I am an undergraduate student in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, majoring in Economics, Computer Science and Mathematics (in that order). There is something intriguing in all of these fields that I do not necessarily how to put into words, nor how they fit together as human constructs that shape our world as we know it.</p>

<h3 id="interests-and-aspirations">Interests and Aspirations</h3>
<p>I have always been fascinated by economics by the ubiquity of it in our daily conversations. These ideas do not solely exist in the abstract, but they permeate into our identities, beliefs and behaviors that collectively shape the society in which we live. For this reason, I was drawn to the field. There is a prevailing thought that economic and the social sciences are completely subjective. While there is some truth in this, modern technology and the availability of data have allowed us to make sense of the society that we live in; we now can make informed decisions with computational methodologies. But as our society is increasingly influenced by computation, there is a need to synthesize these seemingly disparate fields in hopes that the world will benefit from the advancement of technology, and not be harmed by it. I want to be in the discourse and development of this nuance subject matter.</p>

<p>A defining moment that pivoted my interest was during my exploration in the social sciences from the lenses of computer science. The undeniable fact that computation has revolutionized social sciences is laudable, and the advent of such methodologies have enabled the investigation of social science phenomenons that were once considered purely theoretical. Social scientists are encouraged to embrace computation, and even scorned for not doing so. But this is not an exchange, as computer scientists that study social phenomenons are not expected to understand or apply established ideas and even statistical methods.</p>

<p>On the surface, such omission seems to be innocuous. Computation is no longer a reclused field used by researchers in esoteric endeavors; it is practically everywhere. Such an influence has recently been called to attention as computation is no longer a separate part of our society, but actively shaping it. The epiphany of this effect proved to be an optimistic development in our collective consciousness in what role should technology play, but also as to what extent should it be part of our lives.</p>

<p>The field computational social science, or the many derivations of it should perhaps be called socially-conscious computational science; one that not only observes the players of society, trying its best to study society with impartiality but admits it is intrinsically embedded in the fabric of the society. A field that admittedly has much to be developed, and requires more formalism to truly be in sync with the dynamism of social life. With that it carries the burden of not only forecasting, but the unexpectedly more difficult task of uncovering what has happened. That is the daunting foreground that social scientists live with, and no complex algorithm (at the time of writing) has the ability to mask it.</p>
